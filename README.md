# DIgital Image Processing:

## This repository contains the matlab codes with the following functionalities:

1. Reading an input image.
2. Grey Level transformation of the input image:
Gray level transformation, also known as image enhancement, is a fundamental technique in Digital Image Processing (DIP) 
that is used to modify the contrast and brightness of an image by adjusting its pixel values.
3. Histogram equalization of image:
Histogram equalisation is a technique used to adjust the contrast of an image by modifying its histogram. 
The goal is to obtain an output image with a more uniform distribution of pixel values.
4. Spatial-Domain-Filter:
Spatial domain filters are often used to enhance certain features of an image, such as reducing noise or sharpening edges, 
by adjusting the pixel values based on their surrounding values. They can be applied to grayscale or color images.
5. Frequency-Domain-Filter:
In the frequency domain, the image is represented as a set of spatial frequencies, 
and the filter can be applied to adjust the strength or presence of certain frequency components. 
This is achieved by applying mathematical operations to the frequency coefficients obtained through the Fourier Transform of the image.
Frequency domain filters can be used for a variety of tasks, such as noise reduction, edge enhancement, and image restoration.
In the given frequency,spatial and histogram.mlx code import the given test image file.
The .mlx file is a matlab supported extension which is to be opened in either Matlab installed on your machine or matlab online.
